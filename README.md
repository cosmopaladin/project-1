## Stat Analysis
Contained in the files
- airfare.ipynb
- evan.ipybn
- Dimity.ipybn

## Questions this Analysis attempts to cover
- How does GDP growth and airfare prices relate over time?
- Is there a clear relationship between flight demand and a stateâ€™s GDP?
- Do wealthier states have higher or lower airline ticket prices?
- Do lower-income states face higher airfare costs compared to wealthier states?

## Data sources

## Data cleaning
- Some areas like NJ have large amounts of missing flight because they are grouped into metropolitan areas
  - This data was removed during analysis
- There is some unexplained 0 or empty values in this data that was removed

## Interesting Outliers, and caveats with the data sources
- Alaska (As this is only domestic air travel, and there's no all in the US ground route. Plus weather)
- Delaware (has odd/inconsistent flight scheduals)
- The data sets used are not intended for production, but mostly for educational purposes
- 2020 and years after not looked at because of the effects of covid on air travel
